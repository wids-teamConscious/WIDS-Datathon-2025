## **üß† Model Development**


**Neural Network Model**

We decided to go for a Neural Network model because it excels at analyzing complex, non-linear data. We realized traditional models, such as RandomForest, failed to learn the trend and pattern. This model helped us achieve the 0.77918 score on the Kaggle Leaderboard.

Below are the features, hyperparameters, and set up we have for the model:

* Used leakyReLU to avoid dead neurons
* Used Dropout to prevent overfitting, BatchNormalization to improve training stability
* Used EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting and improve model efficiency
* Implemented train_test_spilit with 30% test size, accuracy as evaluation metric, and binary_crossentropy for loss

## **üìà Results & Key Findings**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Kaggle Leaderboard score, F1-score)
* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)


**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**WiDS challenge:**

1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?
